# LocationAwareness
A real-time 3D application of a user's Location

Using data collected from a mySQL database, the application calculates, based on the nearby WiFi Access Points (SSID & RSSI), on which floor the user is. The user is using a mobile app from his mobile (https://github.com/AntonisPlatis92/Wifi-Awareness) to send the data to the server.

After Calculating, the application displays the result in a 3-d model of the 9 Floors of the Building. The location is updated every 3 seconds, making the application real time

It is part of my diploma thesis, giving the live location of the Building-D of the School of Engineering of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki
